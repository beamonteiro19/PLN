They say the holy water's watered down
And this town's lost its faith
Our colors will fade eventually
So if our time is running out day after day
We'll make the mundane our masterpiece

Oh my, my
Oh my, my love
I take one look at you

You're taking me out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down
Till we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
Something so out of the ordinary
You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary
Shatter me with your touch
Oh, Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found

Hopeless hallelujah
Oh, this side of Heaven's gate
Oh, my life, how do ya
Breathe and take my breath away?

At your altar, I will pray
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay
Oh my, my

You're taking me out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down
Till we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
Something so out (out) of the ordinary (ordinary)
You got me kissing the ground (ground) of your sanctuary (sanctuary)
Shatter me with your touch
Oh, Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found

Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my
World was in black and white until I saw your light
I thought you had to die to find

Something so out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down
Till we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
Something so out (out) of the ordinary
You got me kissing the ground (ground) of your sanctuary (sanctuary)
Shatter me with your touch
Oh, Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
