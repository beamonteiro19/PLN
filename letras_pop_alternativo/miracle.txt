Oh, oh, so bittersweet
Yeah, well, she comforts me
I, I, I'm right between
Holy and the edge of the water
Sleeping on the backseat, people walking past me
I was never someone who could turn out the lights
I wonder why
Oh, oh, oh, in my dreams
Yeah, well, she comforts me

They say it's a work of art, every time I fall apart
But it can get so lonely

Oh, I've been waiting for a miracle
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm too late
I got so scared I might have missed it all
Lately, I'm starting to lose faith
Every second I wait, every minute I try
Every hour I waste, a day goes by
Oh, I've been waiting for a miracle
Maybe I'll make it there someday

Oh, oh, I leave tonight
Drive through the warning signs
Cold wind to keep my eyes
Open till I get where I'm going
I'm not gonna slow down, till I see my hometown
Reflected in the mirror like a light in the sky
I know this time
Oh, oh, I won't think twice
Drive through the warning signs

They say it's a work of art, every time I fall apart
But it can get so lonely

Oh, I've been waiting for a miracle
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm too late
I got so scared I might have missed it all
Lately, I'm starting to lose faith
Every second I wait, every minute I try
Every hour I waste, a day goes by
Oh, I've been waiting for a miracle
Maybe I'll make it there someday

Oh, the lies?
Now I understand when nothing ever happens
Overnight, that's alright

Somebody save me with a miracle
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm too late
I got so scared I might have missed it all
Lately, I'm starting to lose faith
Every mess that I made, every fix that I tried
Every hour I waste, a day goes by
Oh, I've been waiting for a miracle
Maybe I'll make it there someday
