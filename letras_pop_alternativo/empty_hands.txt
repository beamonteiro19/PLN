Too late too late
Too late to call
I've been away left you alone
Don't have the words don't have the brains
Money is gone and all that remains is you

I didn't notice you're feeling hopeless
So blue again

And I'm standing there with empty hands
And I'm nothing more than just a man
And it breaks my heart
When I break your heart

And I promised more than I could give
And it's not the life you thought you'd live
And it breaks my heart
When I break your heart

But I've got love
I've got love

Lying awake
Thinking of you
Saturday nights up on the roof
Sundays in bed
Coffee and sleep
Head for a walk
Down by the sea with you

I didn't notice you're feeling hopeless
So blue again

And I'm standing there with empty hands
And I'm nothing more than just a man
And it breaks my heart
When I break your heart

And I promised more than I could give
And it's not the life you thought you'd live
And it breaks my heart
When I break your heart

But I've got love
I've got love

When I come back home I see the lights
That you left on for me every night
When I see you standing at the door
Everything I want for ever more

I've got love
I've got love

And I'm standing there with empty hands
And I'm nothing more than just a man
And it breaks my heart
When I break your heart

And I promised more than I could give
And it's not the life you thought you'd live
And it breaks my heart
When I break your heart

But I've got love
I've got love

But I've got love
I've got love
