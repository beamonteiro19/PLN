Love
Guess you found a way to get through
Got so used to feeling nothing at all
For so long (long)
Now all I wanna do is love you
But my head is holding up my heart
My heart

And I've seen all the signs
What if they're all lies?
Will it even matter what you say?
Can you make these feelings go away?

Tell me, is this real to you?
'Cause I can feel my heart again
You're so tempting, but I'm scared, so I'd rather pretend
That I don't love you like I do
'Cause I don't wanna hurt again
I wanna love you, but I'm scared, so I'd rather pretend

I'd rather pretend
I'd rather pretend, oh

What if I'm at a loss
Hoping you'll come back to me when you're gone?
There's so many ways I've seen this going wrong
So many ways I've seen this fall apart

'Cause I've seen all the signs
What if they're all lies?
Will it even matter what you say?
Can you make these feelings go away?

Tell me, is this real to you?
'Cause I can feel my heart again
You're so tempting, but I'm scared, so I'd rather pretend
That I don't love you like I do
'Cause I don't wanna hurt again
I wanna love you, but I'm scared, so I'd rather pretend

(Pretend)
(Pretend)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
